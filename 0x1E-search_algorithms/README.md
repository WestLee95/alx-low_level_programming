# C - Search Algorithms

**This directory contains**:

-A function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

-A function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

-The time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

-The space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

-The time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

-The space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

-The space complexity of this function / algorithm:

 ```
/*int **allocate_map(int n, int m)
 {
  int **map;
  map = malloc(sizeof(int *) * n);
  for (size_t i = 0; i < n; i++)
  {
   map[i] = malloc(sizeof(int) * m);
  }
  return (map);
 }

```
 
By the end of these one has achieved the following learning objectives:

1.*What is a search algorithm.*

2.*What is a linear search.*

3.*What is a binary search.*

4.*What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs.*
